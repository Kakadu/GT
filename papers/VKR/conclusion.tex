\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}

There are a few possible directions for future work. First, in this paper we did not address the performance issues. As we represent
the transformations in a very generic form with many levels of indirection, obviously, the transformations, implemented with
our framework, are at disadvantage in comparison with hard coded ones in terms of performance. We assume that the performance of transformations
can be essentially improved by applying some techniques like staging~\cite{Staged} or, perhaps, object-specific optimisations.

Another important direction is supporting more kinds of type declarations, in the first hand, GADTs and non-regular types. Although we have some
implementation ideas for this case, the solution we came up with so far makes the interface of the whole framework too cumbersome to use even for
simple cases.

Finally, the typeinfo structure we generate can be used to mimic the \emph{ad-hoc} polymorphism as it contains the implementation of
type-indexed functions. This, together with some proposed extensions~\cite{ModularImplicits}, can open interesting perspectives.
